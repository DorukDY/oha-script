This bash script is my first script that I have published to anyone

This is creaated for fun and at least make some people learn and say "OHA".

Options of OHA:

    -n : shows n number of interesting information

    --version : prints version information

    --help or -h : help page


Installation Instructions:

Clone from github:

    git clone https://github.com/DorukDY/oha-script.git

Go to File Directory:

    cd oha-script

Run install.sh

    ./install.sh

That's all!!!
